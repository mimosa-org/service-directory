The OpenO&M Service Directory specification provides a specification for a Web Service interface for interactions with a Service Directory. This supports the standardized registration and lookup of OIIE services with corresponding scopes and ISBM configuration information.

The Service Directory provides centralized configuration management for the routing of services within an ISBM. An administrator defines applications, the services that each application supports (e.g. publishing information or responding to requests), the scope of the service (e.g. a region or site, a data class such as equipment types, or for an instance of a data class such as a pump), and the corresponding ISBM endpoint, channel, topics, and tokens. An application would then register the services it can provide for a scope with the Service Directory and receive the corresponding ISBM configuration information. Subsequently, applications that need to subscribe or request data would query the Service Directory for a service type and scope and receive the applicable ISBM configuration.
